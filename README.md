**Dear user!**
-------------
Welcome to this README file. If you have made it this far, you might as well try out my new project!

**Here's what you need to do:**

+ First, so we can be on the same page, go ahead and install my requirements.txt file!

    You can do this by entering following command in your terminal:

**pip3 install -r requirements.txt**

Voila!
-

+ Now you should be all set to initiate the program
+ Do not be alarmed by the numerous files in the structure, this is simply to maintain an organized work space :)

How do I play?
- 

+ That's a good question. All you need is your mouse and your keyboard
+ Press:
  + W to advance forward
  + A to go left
  + S to go backwards
  + D to go right
  + Q to go up
  + E to go down

How do I quit?
-
+ !!!!!Never!!!!!
+ Just kidding, of course you can quit, simply press the ESC button on your keyboard and I will see you soon!
